TODO list for SeeBorg v1.0
--------------------------

in no particular order:
 - Use autoconf and automake to generate makefiles
 - Some of the PyBorg features aren't implemented yet
 - On Windows, setlocale() doesn't have any effect
   (this makes MSVC build be unable to do case conversion on
   russian letters, and mingw32 build completely ignores them)
 - Any form of control over join invites behaviour
 - Better CTCP replies (replies to everything with the same thing)
 - Optimize (there's a lot of room for that, like, remove std::string)
 - Write documentation (man pages, win32 chm, so on)

For more, grep the source files for 'TODO'.
