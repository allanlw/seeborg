SeeBorg readme file
-------------------
SeeBorg: a C++ clone of PyBorg, the IRC chatbot written by Tom Morton.

SeeBorg is a random phrase bot that will sit on IRC channel, learning words,
and periodically (configurable) replying with something that doesn't make
much sense at all, but sometimes it's at least funny.

It can learn in any language, not just english, but for better character
processing (like case conversion), you will need to set appropriately
your system locale.

It uses BotNet library written by Christophe CALMEJANE to connect and
interact with IRC servers. The library is included in the tarball.

To compile, read the Makefiles and make any changes required (you may
probably want to change CFCPU to better value), then type `make' and fix
the errors which will be displayed, if any. SeeBorg is in very early stage
of development and probably won't work for you at all yet.

After running make, you'll end up with two executables - seeborg-irc and
seeborg-line, that is, the seeborg that communicates on IRC or linein.
The linein is useful for offline chat with the bot and to test the
modifications done to the dictionary.

Without any parameters, seeborg-irc reads configuration from seeborg-irc.cfg
located in current working directory. If it doesn't exist, it will create one
and terminate, suggesting you to inspect the config file, that's a good idea.


Config settings:
----------------
server         - server to connect to (default: none)
serverport     - port of the server to connect to (default: 6667)
nickname       - nickname (default: SeeBorg)
username       - username (default: SeeBorg)
realname       - realname (default: I am SeeBorg v0.5 beta)
quitmessage    - quit message (default: ByeBye...)
learning       - '1' if learning new words is enabled, '0' if disabled
                 (default: 1)
stealth        - Doesn't work yet, will enable/disable masking as a
                 regular mIRC user
joininvites    - Doesn't work yet, will enable/disable joining to channel
                 invitations

replyrate      - Bot's general reply rate, in percent (default: 1)
replynick      - Bot's reply rate to his nickname, in percent (default: 33)
replymagic     - Bot's reply rate to magic words set in 'magicwords',
                 in percent (default: 33)
autosaveperiod - Autosave period, in seconds (default: 600)
channels       - Space separated channel list to autojoin on connect
                 (default: #test #seeborg)
magicwords     - Space separated magic word list to reply to according to
                 replymagic value, useful if bot has alternative nicknames,
                 like russian. (no default)
owners         - Space separated bot owners' nickname list, the owner's
                 hostname will be locked after each bot restart. (no default)


Portability:
------------
It compiles succesfully with GCC v2.95.3, GCC v3.2, GCC v3.2.2 and MSVC v6.0.
Tested succesfully on Linux 2.4.x, FreeBSD 4.6.2, mingw32 and Win32.

I see no reason why it shouldn't compile and run on any other platform
that is supported by botnet library and supports standard C++.

If compiling under mingw32 and cygwin, you would want to comment out the 
CFUSER=-ptrhead line and uncomment LDFLAGS line (one with -lwsock32)
in the Makefiles.
